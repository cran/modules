cat(gsub("\\n   ", "", packageDescription("modules", fields = "Description")))
```

## Installation

From CRAN:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("modules")
```

From GitHub:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("wahani/modules")
```

# Introduction

The key idea of this package is to provide a unit which is self contained, i.e. 
has it's own scope. The main and most reliable infrastructure for such 
organizational units of source code in the R ecosystem is a package. Compared to
a package modules can be considered ad hoc, but - in the sense of an R-package -
self contained. Furthermore modules typically consist of one file; in contrast
to a package which can wrap an arbitrary number of files.

There are two use cases. First when you use modules to develop scripts, which is
subject of this section; And then inside of packages where modules act more like
objects, as in object-oriented-programming. Outside of packages modules know
only of the base environment, i.e. within a module the base environment is the
only *package* on the *search path*. Also they are always represented as a list
inside R. Thus they can be treated as bags of functions.

In the following examples you will see the function `module` to define modules.
Typically you do not have to call that function explicitly but instead call
`use` to load a module into your current session.

```{r}
library(modules)
m <- module({
  boringFunction <- function() cat("boring output")
})

m$boringFunction()
```

Since they are isolated from the `.GlobalEnv` the following object `hey` can not
be found:

```{r error=TRUE}
hey <- "hey"
m <- module({
  isolatedFunction <- function() hey
})
m$isolatedFunction()
```

## Imports

If you rely on exported objects of packages you can refer to them explicitly
using `::`:

```{r}
m <- module({
  functionWithDep <- function(x) stats::median(x)
})
m$functionWithDep(1:10)
```

Or you can use `import` for *attaching* single objects or packages and `use` for
*attaching* or loading a module:

```{r}
m <- module({
 
  import(stats, median) # make median from package stats available
  
  functionWithDep <- function(x) median(x)

})
m$functionWithDep(1:10)
```

```{r}
m <- module({
  
  import(stats)
  
  functionWithDep <- function(x) median(x)

})
m$functionWithDep(1:10)
```

## Exports

It may also be of interest to control which objects are visible for the client.
You can do that with the `export` function. Note that export accepts regular
expressions which are indicated by a leading '^'.

```{r}
m <- module({
  
  export("fun")
  
  .privateFunction <- identity
  privateFunction <- identity
  fun <- identity
  
})

names(m)
```

## Example: Modules as Parallel Process

One example where you may want to have more control of the enclosing environment 
of a function is when you parallelize your code. First consider the case when a 
*naive* implementation fails.

```{r error=TRUE}
library(parallel)
dependency <- identity
fun <- function(x) dependency(x) 

cl <- makeCluster(2)
clusterMap(cl, fun, 1:2)
stopCluster(cl)
```

To make the function `fun` self contained we can define it in a module. 

```{r}
m <- module({
  dependency <- identity
  fun <- function(x) dependency(x) 
})

cl <- makeCluster(2)
clusterMap(cl, m$fun, 1:2)
stopCluster(cl)
```


# Scripts as modules

You can make scripts into modules with `as.module` or implicitly when you refer 
to a file (or directory) in a call to `use`. Inside such a script you can use
`import` and `use` in the same way you typically use `library`. A major
difference is, that library will not only attach the stated package but also all
packages in the depends field of that dependency. This is something you have to
do manually (explicitly) with `import`. Consider the following example where we
create a module in a temporary file with its dependencies.

```{r}
code <- "
import(methods)
import(aoos)
# This is an example where we rely on functions in 'aoos':
list : generic(x) %g% standardGeneric('generic')
generic(x ~ ANY) %m% as.list(x)
"

fileName <- tempfile(fileext = ".R")
writeLines(code, fileName)
```

Then we can load such a module into this session by the following:

```{r}
someModule <- use(fileName)
someModule$generic(1:2)
```


# Documentation

If you want proper documentation for your functions or modules you really want a
package. However, there are some simple things you can do for ad-hoc
documentation of modules which is to use comments:

```{r}
m <- module({
  fun <- function(x) {
    ## A function for illustrating documentation
    ## x (numeric)
    x
  }
})
```

There are print methods for modules and functions within modules:

```{r}
m
m$fun
```

# Modules with Object Orientation

## S3

S3 method dispatch will not work because of the special search mechanism of 
`UseMethod`. What will work, however, is attaching the module so `UseMethod` can
find the methods.

```{r}
m <- module({
  generic <- function(x) UseMethod("generic")
  generic.numeric <- function(x) cat("method for x ~ numeric")
})
# m$generic(1) # this won't work
use(m, attach = TRUE)
m$generic(1)
```

## S4

More reliable is the dispatch in S4. By default the set functions of the methods
package have side effects in the top level environment. So you would have to set
the appropriate environemnt for the argument 'where'. 'aoos' provides syntactic 
sugar (S4) and has side effects in the environment in which the constructor 
functions are called so method dispatch will work without extra work:

```{r}
m <- module({
  import("methods")
  import("aoos")
  gen(x) %g% cat("default method")
  gen(x ~ numeric) %m% cat("method for x ~ numeric")
})
m$gen("Hej")
m$gen(1)
```

S4 classes (or types in aoos) have side effects in the global environment and S4
classes are searched for in the top level environment. This means that the
module is not self-contained because the class definition will be cached
somewhere else.

```{r}
m <- module({
  import("methods")
  import("aoos")
  numeric : NewType() %type% .Object
})
m$NewType(1)
```
